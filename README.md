> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.

Wesson aims to solve the second problem by using Markov chains to help suggest some
suitable project names based on an input file. In fact, this project named itself.

## Requirements
* Algorithm::MarkovChain
* File::Stream

## TODO
1. Create install script
2. Implement filters to check sources for naming conflicts
3. Add options (min/max length, etc)
